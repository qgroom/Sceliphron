_Sceliphron_ is a genus of predatory wasp that are notable in that they create nests from mud. Indeed, their English common name is mud-daubers. There are 35 species of _Sceliphron_ eight of which occur in Europe. Three of these eight species are alien to Europe and are suspected to have caused a decline in the native species. The adults feed on pollen and nectar mainly from various Apiaceae. Females prey on spiders which are sedated and carried to nests where they are subsequently used as food for the larvae. _Sceliphron_ have the potential to impact, and be impacted upon, by many other species due to a large number of interactions they have. These interactions include visiting flowers, preying on spiders, being parasitised and having inquilines in their nests. Here we have gathered together data from published literature on the interactions of _Sceliphron_ so that we can better understand their interaction network and what impact the invasive species might have on other biodiversity.
